## Issue #13868: Inconsistent exit code handling in pipeline?

### Describe the bug

I just downloaded v0.98.0 to play around with it from the releases and noticed this seemingly inconsistent behavior.

If I understand it correctly, when running a script without a config Nushell is supposed to throw an error if an external command's exit code is non-zero and if the external command is the last in a pipeline, but that does not happen here.

### How to reproduce

Without a config, run each of these lines as a script separately
```nu
"1\n2" | grep -E "[[:alpha:]]" # throws error about exit code 1
"1\n2" | grep -E "[[:alpha:]]" | lines # prints empty list
"1\n2" | grep -E "[[:alpha:]]" | detect columns # throws error about exit code 1
```

### Expected behavior

I expected the final line to return `null` like it does on v0.97.1
